# NAA-ViG
NAA-ViG focus on the speaker recognition task by transforming the audio data into Mel spectrograms, chunking the spectrograms as nodes, constructing the node connection relationships to form a graph, and then training them with the Neighbor Attention Aggregation Vision Graph Neural Network (NAA-ViG) model.
